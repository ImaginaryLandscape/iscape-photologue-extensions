This is an extension for photologue that changes the admin view and greatly simplifies the url patterns to just a gallery list and a gallery detail. The project url conf should include photologueext.urls instead of photologue.urls. 

Both photologue and photologueext should be on the python path and placed in INSTALLED_APPS.

Also add 'photologueext.context_processors.media' to your CONTEXT_PROCESSORS.
